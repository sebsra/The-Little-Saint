I'm glad you chose my art for your project, I hope it proves to be very useful to you.

INTRODUTION

My name is Ericks Azevedo. I created this artwork for study purposes and in the hope that it will be useful for other people's projects. If you're interested in more art, take a look at my page "https://ericksazevedo.itch.io/". I'll be regularly posting new art there whenever possible

LICENSES

* You can use the artwork in both free and commercial projects, as long as you give me credit. For that purpose, use my Instagram profile "@ericks.azevedo".
* You can edit the images as you prefer; for this purpose, I'm providing the files in .aseprite format.
* Selling these assets is not allowed, even if modifications have been made.

INSTRUCTIONS

* In each folder, you will find two ways to import your files: one using image sequences and the other with individual frames. Both methods have their own .aseprite file, in case you want to make modifications.
* Pay attention to the "House_in_the_middle" folder. Inside it, you will find the images split in half, both for the door animation and the window animation. Both of them have the same sprite size, so you just need to overlay one onto the other. I organized it this way because the window and the door have different animation timings, and one is a loop while the other is not.
